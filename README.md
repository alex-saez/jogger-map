### Color-coding Manhattan streets according to jogger preferences

+ Summary: 
This application lets the user define preferences for streets for jogging and color-codes street segements accordingly. As of now, the user can choose the relative importance of two variables: density of trees and flatness of the path (more variables to come). The app also displays nearby water fountains and public restrooms. Data was obtained from NYC Open Data.
